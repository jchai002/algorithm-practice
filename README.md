# algorithm-practice

###This is a collection of algorithms and data structure problems I solved.
###If you want to check them out, just clone the repository. 
###Most of the problems were solved using JavaScript, make sure you have node installed to run them.
###Some files use external libraries (such as lodash), make sure to run 'npm install' before running the file with node.
